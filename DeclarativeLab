Declarative programming is a type of programming where you tell the computer what you wish to accomplish, without describing explicitly how to do it. Imperative programming, on the other hand, requires that you describe how to accomplish any given task in step-by-step instructions. One pro for declarative programming would be the concise fromat available. It significantly reduces the lines of code required to perform many tasks. Another could be its readability. While imperative describes step for step what is happening, declarative allows you to glance at a short line that explains what is happening, allowing a quicker scanning of code. An analogy for the two would be like telling a man to give you a fish (declarative), rather than teaching the man to fish so you can receive a fish (imperative). SwiftUI is largely a declarative language. Learning about built in closrue functions and other tools SwiftUI offers allows you to really take advantage of the declarative nature of SwiftUI.
