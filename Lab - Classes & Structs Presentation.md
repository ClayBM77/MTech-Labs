# Structs and Classes Presentation Requirements

## Objectives

- Review structs and classes
- Learn from each other on what the difference is between a struct and a class.

## Details:

- You will present in groups of 2-3. Create a slideshow with a minimum length of five slides. Explain the following concepts:
    - What a Struct is
    - What a Class is
    - What do they have in common?
    - How are they different?
    - What is the difference between a Reference type and a Value type?
    - What are some examples, metaphors, or visuals that help explain the difference?
    
- You will not be scored on presentation skills or design, but you should put in an effort to polish your presentation in the limited time you have.
- If your presentation has incorrect information, we will pause your presentation, fix it, and then continue to present.
